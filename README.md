## JavaScript
The JavaScript guidelines are based off of [idiomatic.js](https://github.com/rwaldron/idiomatic.js).

The MSS Guidelines will be the same with the following additional rules applied.

1. Whitespace
    * 4-space soft indents are required.  This means four spaces or four spaces representing a tab.

2. Beautiful Syntax
    * 2.A - 2.C should not have `inner-space`.  Refer to 2.D for a syntax without `inner-space`.  Here is an example.
        ```
        function foo(bar, baz) {
            var qux = bar + baz;

            for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                console.log(qux);
        	}
        }
        ```

    * Single quotes must be used.
